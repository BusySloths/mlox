<!-- Tired of tangled configs, YAML jungles, and broken ML pipelines? So were we.

MLOX gives you a calm, streamlined way to deploy, monitor, and maintain production-grade MLOps infrastructure—without rushing.

It's for engineers who prefer thoughtful systems over chaos. Powered by sloths. Backed by open source. -->

Build AI infrastructure you can trust and verify.

MLOX helps you deploy and operate AI systems on sovereign infrastructure, using open-source components and inspectable configurations.

Instead of opaque cloud platforms and brittle YAML jungles, MLOX offers a calm, reproducible way to run production-grade ML, on your own servers or hybrid, with full control.

Designed for teams that need transparency, long-term maintainability, and independence.
Slothfully simple. Open by design.
