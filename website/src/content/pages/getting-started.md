## Sloth-Friendly Setup

Easing into MLOX should feel like a lazy stretch on a sunny branch:

1. Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) – our go-powered task runner.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BusySloths/mlox.git
   ```

3. Mosey into the project and run:

   ```bash
   task first:steps
   ```

This unhurried command crafts a conda environment and gathers every dependency for you.

For a more comprehensive guide on how to install and run the show, please have a look at our **[Installation Guide](https://github.com/BusySloths/mlox/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md)**.
