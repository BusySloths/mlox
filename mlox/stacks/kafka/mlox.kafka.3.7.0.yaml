description: |
  Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform capable of
  handling trillions of events a day. In MLOX it can be used for building real-time
  data pipelines, streaming analytics, and integrating machine learning workloads
  that rely on reliable event delivery. This stack deploys a single-node Kafka broker
  secured with self-signed TLS certificates suitable for development and testing.
