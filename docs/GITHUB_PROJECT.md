# MLOX GitHub Project Organization

## Overview

This document describes how the MLOX project is organized on GitHub, including our approach to project management, issue tracking, milestones, and the workflow from high-level planning to implementation.

## What is MLOX?

MLOX (Machine Learning Operations eXcellence) is an infrastructure management tool that helps individuals, startups, and small teams deploy production-ready MLOps infrastructure in minutes rather than months. Built by BusySloths, MLOX provides:

- **Infrastructure Management**: Deploy and manage servers with Native, Docker, or Kubernetes backends
- **Service Orchestration**: Install and configure MLOps services like MLFlow, Airflow, Feast, LiteLLM, Ollama, and more
- **Security & Configuration**: Centralized secret and configuration management out-of-the-box
- **Cloud Integration**: Support for GCP services (BigQuery, Secret Manager, Storage, Spreadsheets)
- **Development Tools**: CLI and web UI for managing your MLOps stack

## GitHub Project Structure

Our GitHub project organization follows a hierarchical approach that flows from strategic planning down to specific implementation tasks (in theory at least):

```
Strategic Vision
    ‚Üì
GitHub Projects (Epics)
    ‚Üì
Milestones (Releases)
    ‚Üì
Issues (Features/Bugs)
    ‚Üì
Pull Requests (Implementation)
```

### 1. GitHub Projects (Epic Level)

GitHub Projects represent major functional areas or strategic initiatives. Each project contains multiple milestones and serves as a high-level organizing principle.

**Current Active Projects:**

- **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Core**: Core infrastructure management, server operations, networking
- **üîß Services & Integrations**: MLOps service integrations, Docker/K8s support  
- **üéØ User Experience**: CLI, Web UI, documentation, onboarding
- **üîí Security & Configuration**: Authentication, secrets management, configuration
- **üìä Monitoring & Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting
- **üöÄ Community & Growth**: Documentation, tutorials, community building

### 2. Milestones (Release Level)

Milestones represent planned releases or significant development phases. They group related issues that should be completed together.

**Milestone Naming Convention:**

- `v0.x.0` - Major feature releases
- `v0.x.y` - Bug fix releases  
- `Release YYYY.MM` - Time-based releases
- `Epic: [Name]` - Large feature epics spanning multiple releases

**Example Milestones:**

- `v0.2.0 - Enhanced Service Management`
- `v0.3.0 - Kubernetes Support`
- `Release 2024.Q1 - Stability & Documentation`

### 3. Issues (Feature/Task Level)

Issues represent specific features, bugs, or tasks. They are categorized using labels and assigned to milestones and projects.

**Issue Types:**

- üêõ **Bug**: Something isn't working correctly
- ‚ú® **Feature**: New functionality or enhancement
- üìö **Documentation**: Documentation improvements
- üßπ **Maintenance**: Code cleanup, refactoring, dependency updates
- üí° **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing features
- ‚ùì **Question**: Questions about usage or implementation

## Workflow: From Project to Implementation

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Projects)

1. **Project Creation**: Create or update GitHub projects for major functional areas
2. **Project Planning**: Define project goals, scope, and success criteria
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Team discussion and alignment on priorities

### Phase 2: Release Planning (Milestones)

1. **Milestone Creation**: Create milestones for upcoming releases
2. **Issue Grooming**: Break down project goals into specific issues
3. **Priority Assignment**: Assign issues to milestones based on priority and capacity
4. **Effort Estimation**: Estimate complexity and effort for each issue

### Phase 3: Issue Management

1. **Issue Creation**: Create detailed issues with acceptance criteria
2. **Labeling**: Apply appropriate labels for categorization
3. **Assignment**: Assign issues to contributors based on expertise and availability
4. **Discussion**: Use issue comments for clarification and design discussions

### Phase 4: Implementation (Pull Requests)

1. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branches following naming conventions
2. **Development**: Implement the feature following coding standards
3. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Review**: Code review process with at least one approver
5. **Merge**: Merge to main branch and close related issues

## Label System

Our labeling system helps categorize and prioritize work:

### Type Labels

- `type:bug` - Bug reports
- `type:feature` - New features
- `type:enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `type:documentation` - Documentation changes
- `type:maintenance` - Code maintenance and cleanup

### Priority Labels  

- `priority:critical` - Critical bugs or security issues
- `priority:high` - Important features or bugs
- `priority:medium` - Standard priority
- `priority:low` - Nice-to-have improvements

### Component Labels

- `component:cli` - Command line interface
- `component:ui` - Web user interface  
- `component:infrastructure` - Core infrastructure management
- `component:services` - Service integrations
- `component:security` - Security and authentication
- `component:docs` - Documentation

### Status Labels

- `status:needs-triage` - Needs initial review and categorization
- `status:blocked` - Blocked by external dependencies
- `status:in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status:ready-for-review` - Ready for code review

## Contribution Workflow

## Integration with Development Process

### Issue-to-PR Linking

- Use keywords like "Fixes #123" in PR descriptions to auto-close issues
- Reference related issues for traceability
- Update issue status as work progresses

### Release Process

- Create release branches from main
- Update CHANGELOG.md with milestone contents  
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Close milestone when release is complete

### Metrics and Tracking

- Monitor milestone progress for release planning
- Track issue resolution time for process improvement
- Use project boards for visual progress tracking
- Generate release notes from closed issues
