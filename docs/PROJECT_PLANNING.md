# MLOX Project Planning Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to create and manage GitHub projects, milestones, and issues for MLOX development. It provides practical steps for maintainers and contributors to effectively organize work.

## Creating GitHub Projects

### Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Go to the [MLOX repository](https://github.com/BusySloths/mlox)
2. Click on the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose "Board" or "Table" view (Board recommended for Kanban-style workflow)
5. Name your project using our naming convention

### Step 2: Project Setup

**Project Naming Convention:**
- Use emoji prefixes for visual identification
- Format: `üèóÔ∏è [Functional Area]: [Description]`
- Examples:
  - `üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Core: Server & Network Management`
  - `üîß Services & Integrations: MLOps Service Support`
  - `üéØ User Experience: CLI & Web Interface`

**Project Description Template:**
```
## Objective
[Clear statement of what this project aims to achieve]

## Scope
- [Key area 1]
- [Key area 2] 
- [Key area 3]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Timeline
Target completion: [Date/Milestone]
```

### Step 3: Configure Project Views

**Default Columns (Board View):**
- üìã **Backlog** - Issues not yet started
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- üëÄ **Review** - Awaiting code review
- ‚úÖ **Done** - Completed work

**Custom Fields:**
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low, Critical
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 days), Medium (3-5 days), Large (1-2 weeks), XL (2+ weeks)
- **Component**: CLI, UI, Infrastructure, Services, Security, Docs

## Creating Milestones

### Step 1: Plan Your Release

1. Go to Issues ‚Üí Milestones
2. Click "New milestone"
3. Fill in milestone details

**Milestone Information:**
- **Title**: Follow semantic versioning (v0.x.0) or time-based naming
- **Description**: Clear summary of goals and scope
- **Due Date**: Target release date
- **Labels**: Associated labels for filtering

### Step 2: Milestone Planning Template

```markdown
# Milestone: v0.x.0 - [Release Name]

## Goals
- [Primary goal 1]
- [Primary goal 2]
- [Primary goal 3]

## Features
- [ ] Feature 1 (#issue-number)
- [ ] Feature 2 (#issue-number)
- [ ] Feature 3 (#issue-number)

## Bug Fixes
- [ ] Critical bug fix (#issue-number)
- [ ] Important bug fix (#issue-number)

## Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation (#issue-number)
- [ ] Add new tutorials (#issue-number)

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor component X (#issue-number)
- [ ] Update dependencies (#issue-number)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All features implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] No critical bugs remaining

## Release Notes Preview

### Step 3: Issue Assignment

1. Create or identify issues for the milestone
2. Assign issues to the milestone
3. Add appropriate labels and assignees
4. Estimate effort for capacity planning

## Issue Creation Best Practices

### Step 1: Write Clear Issues

**Issue Title Format:**
- `[COMPONENT] Brief description of issue`
- Examples:
  - `[CLI] Add support for service status commands`
  - `[UI] Implement server management dashboard`
  - `[DOCS] Create getting started guide`

### Step 2: Issue Template Usage

**For Features:**
- Use the Feature Request template
- Include user stories and acceptance criteria
- Consider breaking large features into smaller issues

**For Bugs:**
- Use the Bug Report template
- Provide reproduction steps and environment details
- Include error messages and logs

**For Documentation:**
- Use the Documentation template
- Specify target audience and content type
- Provide examples where helpful

### Step 3: Labeling Strategy

**Apply Multiple Labels:**
- **Type**: What kind of work (bug, feature, enhancement, docs)
- **Component**: Which part of the system
- **Priority**: How urgent/important
- **Status**: Current state of the issue

**Special Labels:**
- `good-first-issue` - Suitable for new contributors
- `help-wanted` - Community contributions welcome
- `blocked` - Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- `duplicate` - Duplicate of another issue

## Workflow Management

### Weekly Planning (Maintainers)

1. **Review Milestone Progress**
   - Check completion percentage
   - Identify blocked or delayed issues
   - Adjust timeline if necessary

2. **Triage New Issues**
   - Review and label new issues
   - Assign to appropriate milestones
   - Add to relevant projects

3. **Capacity Planning**
   - Review team availability
   - Balance workload across contributors
   - Identify issues needing help

### Sprint Planning (Optional)

For teams using sprint methodology:

1. **Sprint Duration**: 1-2 weeks
2. **Sprint Goals**: 3-5 focused objectives
3. **Issue Selection**: Based on priority and capacity
4. **Daily Standups**: Track progress and blockers

### Release Planning

**Pre-Release Checklist:**
- [ ] All milestone issues completed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Version numbers bumped
- [ ] Release notes prepared

**Release Process:**
1. Create release branch
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Tag release with semantic version
4. Publish release notes
5. Close milestone
6. Plan next milestone

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Milestone Progress**
   - Percentage completed
   - Issues remaining
   - Time to completion

2. **Issue Resolution**
   - Average time to close
   - Issues by type and priority
   - Backlog growth/reduction

3. **Contributor Activity**
   - Active contributors
   - First-time contributors
   - Review response time

### Using GitHub Insights

1. Go to repository Insights tab
2. Review traffic, contributions, and activity
3. Use project boards for visual progress tracking
4. Generate reports for milestone reviews

## Integration with Development

### Branch Naming
Link branches to issues and projects:
- `feature/123-add-service-management`
- `bugfix/456-fix-authentication-error`
- `docs/789-update-getting-started`

### Commit Messages
Reference issues in commits:
- `feat: add service status command (closes #123)`
- `fix: resolve authentication timeout (fixes #456)`
- `docs: update installation guide (ref #789)`

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Create PR from feature branch
2. Reference related issues
3. Request review from relevant maintainers
4. Address feedback and iterate
5. Merge when approved and tests pass

## Community Engagement

### Encouraging Contributions

1. **Label Issues Appropriately**
   - Mark beginner-friendly issues
   - Highlight help-wanted items
   - Provide clear descriptions

2. **Respond to Contributors**
   - Acknowledge new issues/PRs promptly
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Thank contributors for their work

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep setup instructions current
   - Provide clear contribution guidelines
   - Share project vision and roadmap

## Tools and Automation

### GitHub Actions Integration

Create workflows for:
- Automatic labeling of issues and PRs
- Milestone progress tracking
- Release note generation
- Project board updates

### Project Management Tools

- GitHub Projects (native)
- Linear for advanced project management
- Notion for documentation
- Slack for team communication

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue Assignment Problems
- **Issue**: Contributors unsure what to work on
- **Solution**: Better labeling and clear acceptance criteria

### Milestone Delays
- **Issue**: Milestones consistently running over
- **Solution**: More realistic estimation and scope management

### Communication Gaps
