## Objective
Create comprehensive integration tests for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Sheets service integration.

## Background
We need to ensure reliable testing of the GCP Sheets service integration while properly handling external dependencies.

## Requirements
- [ ] Design and implement integration tests for the GCP Sheets service
- [ ] Establish proper mocking strategy for GCP connection
- [ ] Include test cases for both successful and error scenarios
- [ ] Document the testing approach

## Technical Considerations

### Mocking Strategy Options
1. Use a mock service that simulates GCP Sheets API responses
2. Consider using `unittest.mock` or dedicated mocking libraries
3. Implement test fixtures for common sheet operations

### Test Scenarios to Cover
- Connection establishment
- Authentication flow
- Basic CRUD operations
- Error handling
- Rate limiting scenarios
- Retry mechanisms

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use dependency injection to allow for easy mocking of the GCP client
- Create reusable mock fixtures
- Consider using a local test configuration
- Implement proper cleanup after tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests successfully mock GCP Sheets connection
- [ ] Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
- [ ] All tests can run in CI environment
- [ ] Documentation includes setup instructions for local testing
- [ ] Code coverage meets project standards

## Additional Resources
- Link to GCP Sheets API documentation
- Reference to existing unit tests
- Project testing guidelines
