# Title: Remove direct dependency on multipass-sdk from Python packaging and install via go-task

The PyPI deployment job fails due to a direct dependency on multipass-sdk, which is not supported by PyPI and also installs an old, incompatible version if replaced with the package from PyPI.

**Solution:**
- Remove the direct dependency on multipass-sdk from setup.py, setup.cfg, or requirements.txt (any Python packaging files).
- Instead, add the installation of multipass-sdk to the `go-tasks` taskfile, within the same task that currently installs multipass.
- This ensures the correct version is installed consistently for local development and CI, without interfering with PyPI publishing.

Acceptance criteria:
- multipass-sdk is no longer present as a direct dependency in Python packaging files
- The go-task taskfile installs multipass-sdk alongside multipass in the relevant task
- PyPI deployment succeeds without dependency errors.
