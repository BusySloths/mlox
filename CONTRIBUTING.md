## How To Contribute :rocket:


Hello! :wave: 

Thank you for considering contributing to `MLOX`. There are many ways to contribute, and they are not limited to writing code. We welcome all contributions such as:

- bug reports
- enhancement suggestions
- documentation improvements
- expanding the reusable-snippets and use-cases

This project is intended to be a community effort, and it won't be possible without your support and enthusiasm.

## Where to Start? 

If you're new to open-source development, we recommend going through the [GitHub ‚Äúissues‚Äù tab](https://github.com/busysloths/mlox/issues) to find items that interest you. Once you‚Äôve found something interesting, the next step is to create your development environment.

Keep in mind that MLOX is still in a very early stage and we welcome any idea or improvements.

### Understanding Our Workflow

We use a structured approach to manage development:
- **GitHub Projects**: High-level functional areas and epics
- **Milestones**: Release planning and goal setting  
- **Issues**: Specific features, bugs, and tasks
- **Labels**: Categorization and prioritization

For detailed information about our project organization and workflow, see:
- [GitHub Project Guide](docs/GITHUB_PROJECT.md) - How we organize work and manage projects
- [Project Planning Guide](docs/PROJECT_PLANNING.md) - Detailed steps for creating and managing projects, milestones, and issues
- [Labels Guide](docs/LABELS.md) - Our labeling system for categorizing issues
